Data preperation2.1 Import data\r\n2.2 Clean and tidy data\r\n\r\n\r\n1.Overview\r\n1.1 Background\r\nThis report is based on the mini challenge 2 from VAST Challenge 2021. Here is the background:\r\nGAStech, an oil-products company from Tethys, is expanding into Kronos - an island country, built good relations with the local government as well.Not only GAStech got considerable profit, but also has an impact on the local natural environment. At the beginning of 1997,the residents of Elodis agricultural town located near the capital of Kronos began to pay attention to an abnormal increase in the occurrence of illnesses such as cancer, birth defects,respiratory illnesses, and logical diseases, in addition to a marked decrease in crop yield. And they believe this is related to Gastech’s business.\r\nAfter fail to seeking help from the government, the residents set up their own POK (Protectors of Kronos) organization to protect the ecological environment in Kronos and prevent continuous deterioration. Now the POK has taken on a certain scale.\r\nDuring Gastech’s celebration party in 2014, the unexplained disappearance of some employees was suspected to be related to the POK organization. Due to this,the purpose of this report is to analyze the consumption behaviors of employees at different times and places, use R Studio to visualize the data, screen the existing suspicious behaviors, match the employees with varies of crads, and draw suggestions and conclusions.\r\n1.2 Dataset introduced\r\nMC2 includes 4 CSV format files and a tourist map of Abila with locations of interest identified.\r\n– Car-assignments: includes 45 detailed records of vehicle assignments by employees.\r\n– Cc_data: contains 1491 credit and debit card transaction amount records in various of locations.\r\n– Loyalty_data: 1393 observations of loyalty card transaction of GAStech’s employees.\r\n– Gps: records the latitude and longitude number by employees.\r\n2.

Sketch Design3.1 Sketch\r\n3.2 Advantages\r\n\r\n4. Data Visualization4.1 Data Preparation Process\r\n4.2 Data Visualization Steps\r\n\r\n5.Final Visualization\r\n6. Main Observation\r\n\r\n1. The original visualization\r\n The data comes from the Singapore Statistic, which records the monthly volume of imports and exports of Singapore by varies of regions/markets from January 1976 to April 2021. And this report is going to visualize the merchandise trade changes between different regions with Singapore during 2011 to 2020.\r\n2. Comments on the clarity and aesthetics.\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nNo.\r\nCritiques\r\nSuggestion\r\n1\r\nThe solid circles showed transaction volume of different regions covered each other. Such as EU, more than half of the dark blue one has covered by United States, the turquoise circle. The same thing happened in Republic of Korea, which was almost entirely covered by Japan. This leads to an incomplete representation of the trade volume information in the diagram, readers cannot compare the size of transactions in different regions.\r\nWe can filter different regions in Tableau in order to choosing either individual regions or all of those.\r\n2\r\nThe content of commentary and chart are inconsistent. Commentary should be based on the charts that have been made. The original chart did not show any information about changes of dates (years), but commentary mentions two specific years which is 2006 and 2009, are not supported by chart data.\r\nCommentary is written based on the content of Graph to supplement interesting observations of details in Graph, so we can focus on main observations.\r\n3\r\nlack of indicating which time periods are used in the chart. The original Visualization did not specify the period of time for the merchandise trade being studied, and also lacked clear notations. Therefore, it will cause misunderstanding for readers.\r\nChange the form to interactive visualization, highlights the time change by turning the time into a reader-selectable option.\r\n4\r\nMissing graph title. The original graph did not set an appropriate title to summarize the main content, so is short of highlighting the point that intended to express.\r\nAdd appropriate graph title.\r\n2.2 Aesthetics\r\nNo.\r\nAesthetics\r\nSuggestion\r\n1\r\nThe choice of background color is not appropriate. There are already varies of colors and labels of regions in the graph, and the light blue and green background colors that represent Net Import and Net Export belong to the same color range with some regions’ circles, hard for readers to clearly distinguish and makes the whole graph messy.\r\nDo not set another background color. Keep the transparent color.\r\n2\r\nStatic bubble plot may not be the most appropriate visualization method.Because the raw data include the imports and exports volume changes through years between different regions and Singapore, the original chart does not capture this dynamic demand well.\r\nAdd Animation funtion in Tableau.\r\n3\r\nNote’s position is not impressive enough. The font of notes is too small for the reader to recognize below the graph, and the position is also not so obvious.\r\nChange the Note in front of the graph or change the color and font of it.\r\n4\r\nInappropriate location for axis title.Crossing titles on the horizontal and vertical axes in the lower left corner can be misleading, since Exports is more like vertical title, while Imports are closer to the horizontal axis. The locations need to be changed.\r\nPlace the names of the axes halfway between the horizontal and vertical axes.\r\n3. Sketch Design\r\n3.1 Sketch\r\n\r\n3.2 Advantages\r\n1)Added timeline options. The static Bubble Plot has been turned into an interactive mode. Reader can drag the time option to observe the changes in the amount of trade between Singapore and different regions at different times,which can help Reader to choose the time more accurately.\r\n2)Add appropriate titles and commentary to make the directivity and content of plot clearer.\r\n3)Add a filter option to allow users to freely select the region to view.\r\n4)Reduce the use of the same color range of background, the overall chart looks clean and tidy.\r\n4. Data Visualization\r\n4.1 Data Preparation Process\r\nThere are 3 worksheets in the original file, “T1” means the merchandise imports in Singapore by different region/market, “T2” means the merchandise exports in Singapore by different region/market, monthly during 1976 Jan to 2021 April, including 121 rows in total.\r\nFirst to clean the redundant worksheet “Content” and delete needless content in T1 and T2 datasets, renamed as “Import” and “Export” respectively.\r\nFor Import Dataset\r\nClean Data In order to observe the data better and not be affected by the maximum value, we need to delete the continent representing the collection of regions such as Europe, Asia, Africa and America, and finally keep the 82 regions are both shown in Export and Import dataset. Meanwhile, it was found that the value of “Germany, Democratic Republic Of” and “Yemen Democratic” from 2011 to 2020 were zero, so they were deleted also. The new dataset was shown below: \r\nSum each year and transpose data In Export Worksheet, add up the monthly data from 2011 to 2020 according to different years, then copy => Transpose. The result: \r\nFor Export dataset\r\n3. Repeat the same 2 steps\r\nAdd new worksheet “Total”\r\nAdd the Import and Export values for each region correspondingly in a new worksheet named “Total”. The formula is: \r\nThen the data preparation steps in Excel is all done, save this file as “Data Final”.\r\n4.2 Data Visualization Steps\r\nImport the Excel “Data” into Tableau\r\nPivot and connect three datasets First pivot each dataset, select the data from 2011 to 2020, right click => Pivot, and rename the Import new pivot columns as follow:\r\nAnd also change the Export as “Region_Ex” and “Export_Value” respectively, the columns in Total as “Region_T” and “Total_Value”.\r\nThen connect three datasets by same columns - Region and Year. \r\n\r\nFor Sheet 1\r\nChange the data type Change all the Year data type from “String” to “Date” \r\nCreate bubble plot Drag “Export_Value” and “Import_Value” to Columns and Rows respectively.\r\nSet size and color Drag “Region_T” to Color. Drag “Total_Value” to Size. Change the Marks to Circle.\r\nRight click on “Region_T” => “Sort”, change the setting as descending in order of “Total_Value”.\r\nApply filter and pages. Right click on “Region_T” => Sort, manually adjust the order of regions as shown in the Color panel above as the same, therefore, in the control panel of Filter, the trade volume of each region can be sorted according to its size:\r\nThen,drag “Region_T” to Filter, choose all of the regions, then left click => Show Filter.\r\nDrag “Year (Total)” to Pages, the panel shown below:\r\nFormat horizontal and vertical axes\r\nRight click on each axis => Format.\r\nIn the Pane interface, Numbers => Currency (Custom) => Billions (B), only keep one decimal places.\r\nTurn on Animations Format => Animations, open the animations. Set the Duration to smooth speed, 1 seconds (Slow).\r\nCreate New Calculated Field 1)Create new column named Trade Balance, compare export and import value, and if export > import, means Singapore has a trade surplus with the region, if import > export, means Singapore has a trade deficit with the region. \r\n2)Create new column named Difference, it it the value of export minus import. \r\n9.Justify Tool tip Drag “Trade Balance” and “Difference” to Tool tip, then justify as shown below: \r\nThen change the format of “Difference” to the same as other numbers.\r\nAdd a Reference Line on the diagonal\r\nAdd Labels Drag “Region_T” to Label\r\nFor Sheet 2\r\n1. Create line chart Drag “Year”, “Import_Value” and “Export_Value” to Columns and Rows respectively.\r\nApply Color, Tooltip, Filter and Label. Drag “Measure Names” to Color and Label Drag “Region_T” and “Difference” to Tooltip Drag “Year” to Filter \r\nAdjust the line chart Change all the axes format to the same as Sheet 1, right click on synchronize axis, then change the rows name to “Import” and “Export” respectively.\r\nAdd tittle Add tittle:Changes in the volume of imports and exports, 2011-2020\r\nChange the Tooltip \r\nFor Sheet 3 1.Create the bar chart Drag “Total_Value” and “Region_Im” to Columns and Rows respectively.\r\n2.Apply Filter and and Pages Drag “Region_Im” to Filter Drag “Year” to “Pages” \r\n3.Show Labels Left click on Label => show mark labels\r\n4.Add tittle Add tittle: Changes in total volume in top ten regions, 2011-2020\r\nFor Dashboard\r\nJoin the three sheets into one dashboard first.\r\nAdd Tittle\r\nAdd tittle: Changes of Merchandise Trade Volume with Singapore,2011-2020.\r\nAdjust the Legend\r\nDelete the Sum_Total panel and the Color panel\r\nChange the size\r\nSet the Size to “Automatic”.\r\nAdd Commentary\r\n2011 - 2014, Singapore’s largest trading partner was Malaysia, after 2014, mainland China became the largest trading partner.\r\nAdd Annotation\r\nHong Kong is the top net exporter, United States is the top net importer in 2011-2017, then change to Taiwan.\r\nAdd notes Add notes in the bottom of the graph: The size of the circle represents the total volume of merchandise trade; Region names in right control is in descending order according to the total volume size.\r\n5.Final Visualization\r\nThe final dashboard: \r\n6. Main Observation\r\n6.1 Since 2013, China has surpassed Malaysia to become Singapore’s largest trading partner.\r\nIn 2011, the total amount of merchandise trade between Singapore and China was 101.7B dollars, and Malaysia was 113.3B dollars, which is already very close. In 2012, the amount of merchandise trade between Singapore and China has increased slightly.Until 2013, China grew rapidly to become Singapore’s largest exporter and importer.Since 2013, the total volume of trade between Singapore and China has far exceeded that of any other region, and Singapore has been running a trade surplus with China, that is, exports exceed imports.\r\nFurthermore, in 2020, the total amount of trade with the United States will be 102.4B dollars, only 1B dollars less than Malaysia’s 103.5B dollars, possibly due to the impact of the COVID-19, the trade with Malaysia has decreased slightly year by year.\r\n6.2 In 2017, the top net importer changed from United States to Taiwan, Hong Kong has been the top net exporter.\r\nSingapore ran a trade deficit with the United States from 2011 to 2017.From 2011 to 2014, the difference between exports and imports remained at about 20B dollars, until 2015, when the difference gradually moved closer to a positive value, meaning more of Singapore’s own goods were exported to the US.\r\n6.3 Singapore runs a trade surplus for most of the top 10 regions by volume.\r\nOver the past decade, the top 10 regions with which Singapore traded were China, Malaysia, the United States, Indonesia, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and India. In 2011, Singapore achieved the same ratio of trade surplus and trade deficit, each accounting for 50%. This situation lasted until 2017, when it achieved a trade surplus with India of 5.2B dollars. By 2018, it gradually realized more exports than imports to Malaysia and South Korea, and by 2020, except Taiwan and Japan, Singapore ran surpluses with the rest. It can be seen that Singapore’s overall trade situation is in surplus in recent years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1. Critic the Original Visualisation\r\n The dataset used in above graph is provided by the Department of Statistics, Singapore, which illustrated the external trade among different countries and regions, including the numbers of dollars of total merchandise imports and exports from 1976 to 2021, explained the trade flows between Singapore and different markets.\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\n1)Inexact title\r\nThe title of this graph is not so precise and consistent with the content. The directivity of the question is not obvious. It is not clear exactly who is these countries’ trade with, whether it is the value of their own imports and exports or the value of their trade with Singapore, and meanwhile, the exactly meaning of “top” is not well-directed, is the top number of goods or the top volume of money.\r\nSuggestion: Add the detail sub title, change the meaning of the title, and add the subject.\r\n2)Vertical axis lacks label’s units\r\nThe vertical axis “0M, 2M, 4M…”and other numbers, the meaning of these expressions are not clear enough, lack of numerical units. Readers do not know whether these figures represent the number of imports and exports of goods or the total amount of trade between Singapore and these countries. Because lack of specific labels, failed to convey effective information to the readers and the purpose is unclear.\r\nSuggestion:Add the units of the coordinate axis to clarify the specific meaning of the number - representing the amount of trade transactions.\r\n3)Japan’s graph has only one year of data\r\nJapan had no data missing from the original dataset, and the other five countries all analyzed two years of complete data, so it is important to make sure that the analysis for all six countries comes from the same time period as possible.\r\nSuggestion:Add data for 2019\r\n4)Different two-side tick marks in vertical axis\r\nFrom the original graph, it is not hard to see that the axis label on both sides of the vertical axis in two countries, Hong Kong and Taiwan are different. And the width of the tick marks on both sides of the vertical axis in the rest four countries are also inconsonant. This setting may cause the trend line inside the graph to deviate from the correct direction, and it is difficult to directly compare the differences in the value of imports and exports.\r\nSuggestion:Modify the vertical axis to a uniform range; Change the two axes into one axis.\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\n1)Area chart may not be a very appropriate visualization method\r\nBecause the data is intended to show time-series changing and comparing import and export amounts, the use of area chart will cause trouble for readers to read, making the information of the whole graph not very clear. Meanwhile, it is quite misleading and unclear to use shadows to represent the difference, because the shadow is not only hard to identify but also cannot precisely reflect the changing of difference between import and export monthly.\r\nSuggestion:Create two-line charts show the change of the import and export volume of each market in 2019 and 2020, while a bar chart shows the difference between the export volume and the import volume.\r\n2)Unclear axis title\r\nThe title on the Y-axis doesn’t show what the meaning and unit of the number is, so it is kind of confused to read.\r\nSuggestion:Modify the Y axis title and add units.\r\n3)Missing necessary commentary and annotation\r\nThe whole graph has not highlight necessary and concise commentary and annotation.\r\nSuggestion:Add the necessary commentary and reader-friendly annotation according to the final chart.\r\n4)Not suitable for the current graph color matching\r\nThere is no big problem with the color matching between blue and orange. However, as he tried to use shadow to show trade surplus deficit, orange will cover blue, causing confusion between the color of shadow and orange, which is not easy to read.\r\nSuggestion: Modify color combinations to better match and fit.\r\n2.Proposed Data Visualisation\r\n2.1 A sketch of proposed design\r\n\r\n2.2 Advantages of proposed design\r\n1)Improved the correctness of graph title:\r\nAdd more detailed sub titles and the readers can more clearly understand the main purpose and the content of the chart.\r\n2)Select a combination of line chart and bar chart to visualize data:\r\nThe expansion of one chart into three i. clearly shows the trend and size of each region’s trade in 2019 and 2020; ii. more intuitively shows the positive and negative values of the trade to identify the trade is deficit or not.\r\n3)Well defined axis label and appropriate thick marks:\r\nThe previous chart lacked units on the vertical axis, so the numerical significance of the vertical axis was not clear. The addition of units and unified thick marks made it more convenient to compare the difference value of each region.\r\n4)Improved color matching:\r\nAdopted a more harmonious color match than before to increase the aesthetic.\r\n5) More information is showed from Dataset\r\nIt reflects the trend of trade volume between Singapore and six major markets, and more intuitively reflects the relationship between exports and imports in different markets in different months.\r\n3. Data Visualisation\r\nThe data file consists of three worksheets: Content, T1 and T2. First need to rename T1 to Import and T2 to Export, then delete useless worksheet Content.  These two datasets include data for 119 countries and regions from January 1976 to April 2021.\r\nThe final visualisation consists of three parts, which are\r\nTable 1 – Changes of export value in Singapore.\r\nTable 2 – Changes of import value in Singapore.\r\nTable 3 – Changes of balance of trade.\r\n3.1 Data Preparation\r\nFor Import dataset (Table 2)\r\n1)Remove redundant columns and rows. Delete extra columns and only keep data from January 2019 to December 2020.\r\nUse Filter to delete data of other markets, leaving only six rows of data – Hong Kong, Mainland China, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and U.S.\r\nRename header and country names Rename header from “Variables” to “Markets” and delete “Thousands Dollars” in each row. \r\n3)Transpose dataset For better identification in Tableau, we need each country as a column and each time as a column, so copy all the data in Excel first and then use Transpose function to process the data.\r\nThen rename the headers the new dataset showing as following:\r\nFor Export dataset (Table 1)\r\n1)Repeat the same three steps in Import dataset \r\nFor Table 3\r\n1)Create new worksheet to calculate the difference Create a new worksheet called “Balance of Trade” and use function “Export minus Import” to calculate the difference.\r\nIf exports are greater than imports, that means the difference is greater than zero, then Singapore has achieved a Trade surplus in this period. If exports are smaller than imports, that means the difference is less than zero. This indicates that Singapore has a trade deficit with the country during this period. \r\nSave the new Excel file as “Trade Data” and derive new Tableau workbook then import the file.\r\n3.2 Data Visualisation\r\nCreate relationship between these three datasets.\r\nCombine these three datasets by using column “Time”. \r\nPivot two datasets Because countries from Malaysia to the U.S are spread across multiple columns, we need to select the them then right click and use “Pivot” to change it in the correct format. Repeat this step in “Import” and “Export” datasets. \r\nRename headers For Export dataset, rename the first “Pivot Field Names” to “Market” and rename the second “Pivot Field Values” to “Amount”. \r\nAnd also do the same step in the Import datasets, rename the first “Pivot Field Values” to “Market 2”, the second to “Amount 2” respectively.\r\nFor Export dataset (table 1)\r\nCreate new sheet and name as “Export”.\r\nChange data type\r\nChange “Time” data type from string to date, and change “Export Trade Amounts” data type to “Number (whole)” then to the right side click “Convert to Continuous”. \r\nCreate line chart Drag “Time” and “Export Trade Amount” to Columns and Rows respectively. Then change the format of “Time”. Click the little arrow of “Year (Time)” change Time to Year and next Time to Month. \r\nChange the months in X-axis into numbers Right click on the X-axis => Format => Dates => Numeric.\r\nApply Color Drag “Market” to color option, change “Automatic” to “Line” and change “Markers” to the second option, which in order to more clearly correspond to each time node.\r\nChange the number format. Right click on Y-axis => Format, then go to pane option, change the Numbers to Currency (Standard) => English (Singapore).\r\nChange “Standard” to “Fit Height”\r\nAdd title Add title - Changes of export value in Singapore. Next to adjusted the title to right color, location and size.\r\nFor import dataset (Table 2)\r\nCreate a new Sheet, named as “Import” and repeat the first 6 steps in Table1.\r\nAdd title Add title: Changes of import value in Singapore and change the right color, location and size.\r\nFor Table 3:\r\nChange data type Change Time from String to Date, change Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, United States, Mainland China and Hong Kong from String to Number (whole), and convert all to continuous.\r\nAnd as showing in the previous step, click on the small arrow changing Time to Month format.\r\nCreate bar chart Drag “Time” and “Hong Kong, Japan, Mainland China, Malaysia, Taiwan and United State” to Columns and Rows respectively. Change Time to Year and next Time to Month. \r\nApply colors one by one. Drag country name to Color option, double-click on Legend on the right, edit color to 2 steps – Positive difference is dark blue, negative is light blue.\r\nApply the same color group in each country. \r\nAdjust the range of the Y axis Except Hong Kong and Taiwan, to adjust the range of the rest five countries to be the same.

Exports fluctuated from January to July 2019, rising significantly until July, and then dropping to normal levels in August. Exports began to rise slowly after August. And the same trend is seen in 2020 too. Although the export volume of Singapore to the Mainland China declined slightly from January to May 2020, it has seen a significant increase since July, and its export volume is much higher than that of the second place Hong Kong.\r\nIn terms of imports, both 2019 and 2020 showed a similar pattern from January to March - Singapore’s imports from China dropped from January to February, then rose sharply in February. From March to October, it showed a relatively gentle fluctuation, rising from October to November and then falling.\r\n4.2 Singapore’s main export market is Hong Kong and its main import market is Taiwan.\r\nAs can be seen from the bar chart on the left, both in 2019 and 2020, Singapore’s imports are greater than exports, presenting a trade deficit with Taiwan. The exact opposite situation appears in the trade between Singapore and Hong Kong - for two years, exports exceeded imports, that is, trade surplus, showing a high profit pattern.\r\n4.3 Trade deficits are more common in 2020 than in 2019\r\nExcluding two regions, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the bar chart with negative numbers in 2020 is more than that in 2019. As can be seen from the chart of the United States, both Singapore and the United States had a trade surplus throughout 2019. However, since 2020, the net export volume has been decreasing month by month, and it has been in a trade deficit since April. Although the net export volume was slightly positive in September and October, it still fell back to the state of exports being less than imports. It has had a trade surplus with China since August, but has been in deficit with Malaysia since 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
