Critic the Original Visualisation\r\n The dataset used in above graph is provided by the Department of Statistics, Singapore, which illustrated the external trade among different countries and regions, including the numbers of dollars of total merchandise imports and exports from 1976 to 2021, explained the trade flows between Singapore and different markets.\r\n1.1 Clarity\r\n1)Inexact title\r\nThe title of this graph is not so precise and consistent with the content. The directivity of the question is not obvious. It is not clear exactly who is these countries’ trade with, whether it is the value of their own imports and exports or the value of their trade with Singapore, and meanwhile, the exactly meaning of “top” is not well-directed, is the top number of goods or the top volume of money.\r\nSuggestion: Add the detail sub title, change the meaning of the title, and add the subject.\r\n2)Vertical axis lacks label’s units\r\nThe vertical axis “0M, 2M, 4M…”and other numbers, the meaning of these expressions are not clear enough, lack of numerical units. Readers do not know whether these figures represent the number of imports and exports of goods or the total amount of trade between Singapore and these countries. Because lack of specific labels, failed to convey effective information to the readers and the purpose is unclear.\r\nSuggestion:Add the units of the coordinate axis to clarify the specific meaning of the number - representing the amount of trade transactions.\r\n3)Japan’s graph has only one year of data\r\nJapan had no data missing from the original dataset, and the other five countries all analyzed two years of complete data, so it is important to make sure that the analysis for all six countries comes from the same time period as possible.\r\nSuggestion:Add data for 2019\r\n4)Different two-side tick marks in vertical axis\r\nFrom the original graph, it is not hard to see that the axis label on both sides of the vertical axis in two countries, Hong Kong and Taiwan are different. And the width of the tick marks on both sides of the vertical axis in the rest four countries are also inconsonant. This setting may cause the trend line inside the graph to deviate from the correct direction, and it is difficult to directly compare the differences in the value of imports and exports.\r\nSuggestion:Modify the vertical axis to a uniform range; Change the two axes into one axis.\r\n1.2 Aesthetics\r\n1)Area chart may not be a very appropriate visualization method\r\nBecause the data is intended to show time-series changing and comparing import and export amounts, the use of area chart will cause trouble for readers to read, making the information of the whole graph not very clear. Meanwhile, it is quite misleading and unclear to use shadows to represent the difference, because the shadow is not only hard to identify but also cannot precisely reflect the changing of difference between import and export monthly.\r\nSuggestion:Create two-line charts show the change of the import and export volume of each market in 2019 and 2020, while a bar chart shows the difference between the export volume and the import volume.\r\n2)Unclear axis title\r\nThe title on the Y-axis doesn’t show what the meaning and unit of the number is, so it is kind of confused to read.\r\nSuggestion:Modify the Y axis title and add units.\r\n3)Missing necessary commentary and annotation\r\nThe whole graph has not highlight necessary and concise commentary and annotation.\r\nSuggestion:Add the necessary commentary and reader-friendly annotation according to the final chart.\r\n4)Not suitable for the current graph color matching\r\nThere is no big problem with the color matching between blue and orange. However, as he tried to use shadow to show trade surplus deficit, orange will cover blue, causing confusion between the color of shadow and orange, which is not easy to read.\r\nSuggestion: Modify color combinations to better match and fit.\r\n2.Proposed Data Visualisation\r\n2.1 A sketch of proposed design\r\n\r\n2.2 Advantages of proposed design\r\n1)Improved the correctness of graph title:\r\nAdd more detailed sub titles and the readers can more clearly understand the main purpose and the content of the chart.\r\n2)Select a combination of line chart and bar chart to visualize data:\r\nThe expansion of one chart into three i. clearly shows the trend and size of each region’s trade in 2019 and 2020; ii. more intuitively shows the positive and negative values of the trade to identify the trade is deficit or not.\r\n3)Well defined axis label and appropriate thick marks:\r\nThe previous chart lacked units on the vertical axis, so the numerical significance of the vertical axis was not clear. The addition of units and unified thick marks made it more convenient to compare the difference value of each region.\r\n4)Improved color matching:\r\nAdopted a more harmonious color match than before to increase the aesthetic.\r\n5) More information is showed from Dataset\r\nIt reflects the trend of trade volume between Singapore and six major markets, and more intuitively reflects the relationship between exports and imports in different markets in different months.\r\n3. Data Visualisation\r\nThe data file consists of three worksheets: Content, T1 and T2. First need to rename T1 to Import and T2 to Export, then delete useless worksheet Content.  These two datasets include data for 119 countries and regions from January 1976 to April 2021.\r\nThe final visualisation consists of three parts, which are\r\nTable 1 – Changes of export value in Singapore.\r\nTable 2 – Changes of import value in Singapore.\r\nTable 3 – Changes of balance of trade.\r\n3.1 Data Preparation\r\nFor Import dataset (Table 2)\r\n1)Remove redundant columns and rows. Delete extra columns and only keep data from January 2019 to December 2020.\r\nUse Filter to delete data of other markets, leaving only six rows of data – Hong Kong, Mainland China, Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia and U.S.\r\nRename header and country names Rename header from “Variables” to “Markets” and delete “Thousands Dollars” in each row. \r\n3)Transpose dataset For better identification in Tableau, we need each country as a column and each time as a column, so copy all the data in Excel first and then use Transpose function to process the data.\r\nThen rename the headers the new dataset showing as following:\r\nFor Export dataset (Table 1)\r\n1)Repeat the same three steps in Import dataset \r\nFor Table 3\r\n1)Create new worksheet to calculate the difference Create a new worksheet called “Balance of Trade” and use function “Export minus Import” to calculate the difference.\r\nIf exports are greater than imports, that means the difference is greater than zero, then Singapore has achieved a Trade surplus in this period. If exports are smaller than imports, that means the difference is less than zero. This indicates that Singapore has a trade deficit with the country during this period. \r\nSave the new Excel file as “Trade Data” and derive new Tableau workbook then import the file.\r\n3.2 Data Visualisation\r\nCreate relationship between these three datasets.\r\nCombine these three datasets by using column “Time”. \r\nPivot two datasets Because countries from Malaysia to the U.S are spread across multiple columns, we need to select the them then right click and use “Pivot” to change it in the correct format. Repeat this step in “Import” and “Export” datasets. \r\nRename headers For Export dataset, rename the first “Pivot Field Names” to “Market” and rename the second “Pivot Field Values” to “Amount”. \r\nAnd also do the same step in the Import datasets, rename the first “Pivot Field Values” to “Market 2”, the second to “Amount 2” respectively.\r\nFor Export dataset (table 1)\r\nCreate new sheet and name as “Export”.\r\nChange data type\r\nChange “Time” data type from string to date, and change “Export Trade Amounts” data type to “Number (whole)” then to the right side click “Convert to Continuous”. \r\nCreate line chart Drag “Time” and “Export Trade Amount” to Columns and Rows respectively. Then change the format of “Time”. Click the little arrow of “Year (Time)” change Time to Year and next Time to Month. \r\nChange the months in X-axis into numbers Right click on the X-axis => Format => Dates => Numeric.\r\nApply Color Drag “Market” to color option, change “Automatic” to “Line” and change “Markers” to the second option, which in order to more clearly correspond to each time node.\r\nChange the number format. Right click on Y-axis => Format, then go to pane option, change the Numbers to Currency (Standard) => English (Singapore).\r\nChange “Standard” to “Fit Height”\r\nAdd title Add title - Changes of export value in Singapore. Next to adjusted the title to right color, location and size.\r\nFor import dataset (Table 2)\r\nCreate a new Sheet, named as “Import” and repeat the first 6 steps in Table1.\r\nAdd title Add title: Changes of import value in Singapore and change the right color, location and size.\r\nFor Table 3:\r\nChange data type Change Time from String to Date, change Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia, United States, Mainland China and Hong Kong from String to Number (whole), and convert all to continuous.\r\nAnd as showing in the previous step, click on the small arrow changing Time to Month format.\r\nCreate bar chart Drag “Time” and “Hong Kong, Japan, Mainland China, Malaysia, Taiwan and United State” to Columns and Rows respectively. Change Time to Year and next Time to Month. \r\nApply colors one by one. Drag country name to Color option, double-click on Legend on the right, edit color to 2 steps – Positive difference is dark blue, negative is light blue.\r\nApply the same color group in each country. \r\nAdjust the range of the Y axis Except Hong Kong and Taiwan, to adjust the range of the rest five countries to be the same. Edit axis range to Fixed and start with -2,492,896 (the lowest value of a negative number in the five countries Automatic), end with 2574795 (the largest positive number of automatic in five countries). And for Hong Kong, only change the Fixed end with -1000000, for Taiwan, start to 1000000.\r\nAdd annotation A positive value above the zero mark indicates a trade surplus, while a negative value below indicates a trade deficit.\r\nChange the months in X-axis into numbers Right click on the X-axis => Format => Dates => Numeric.\r\nAdd title Add title: Changes of balance of trade.\r\nFor Dashboard 1\r\nDelete extra Legend. There are a lot of redundant Legends on the right side of Dashboard, which look very messy, so it needs to be removed.\r\nChange the size Change the size to Automatic.\r\nAdd and format title Add title: Changes of merchandise trade volume in Singapore with the top six countries, 2019-2020.\r\nFormat title: add grey shading.\r\nAdd commentary\r\nAdd commentary below the title in Table 3: The balance of trade = Export – Import Unit: thousands dollars.\r\nAdd sub title of Y-axis in Export and Import graphs. Sub title: $thousands.\r\nAdd source Choose Objects => Text => drag to bottom left and add:\r\nSource: Statistic SingaporeLink\r\n3.3 Final Visualisation\r\n\r\n4 Observations\r\n4.1 Singapore’s main trading partner is Mainland China\r\nAs can be seen from the line chart on the right, trade between China and Singapore is the largest in both 2019 and 2020. Exports fluctuated from January to July 2019, rising significantly until July, and then dropping to normal levels in August. Exports began to rise slowly after August. And the same trend is seen in 2020 too. Although the export volume of Singapore to the Mainland China declined slightly from January to May 2020, it has seen a significant increase since July, and its export volume is much higher than that of the second place Hong Kong.\r\nIn terms of imports, both 2019 and 2020 showed a similar pattern from January to March - Singapore’s imports from China dropped from January to February, then rose sharply in February. From March to October, it showed a relatively gentle fluctuation, rising from October to November and then falling.\r\n4.2 Singapore’s main export market is Hong Kong and its main import market is Taiwan.\r\nAs can be seen from the bar chart on the left, both in 2019 and 2020, Singapore’s imports are greater than exports, presenting a trade deficit with Taiwan. The exact opposite situation appears in the trade between Singapore and Hong Kong - for two years, exports exceeded imports, that is, trade surplus, showing a high profit pattern.\r\n4.3 Trade deficits are more common in 2020 than in 2019\r\nExcluding two regions, Taiwan and Hong Kong, the bar chart with negative numbers in 2020 is more than that in 2019. As can be seen from the chart of the United States, both Singapore and the United States had a trade surplus throughout 2019. However, since 2020, the net export volume has been decreasing month by month, and it has been in a trade deficit since April. Although the net export volume was slightly positive in September and October, it still fell back to the state of exports being less than imports. It has had a trade surplus with China since August, but has been in deficit with Malaysia since 2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
